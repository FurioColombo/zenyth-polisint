# Zenynth

Zenynth is a minimal powerful Semi-Modular Synthetizer, able to generate all of the most iconic Synth's sounds.

It features infinite Synth Engines (of 4 different types), Noise generators, 3 Filter Chains, and 3 FX chains (each one made by 5 effects to choose from: Delay, Reverb, Distortion, Vibrato, Pan, and Chorus).
5 freely assignables Modulators and a main ADSR Envelope allow to shape the sound further and produce crazy noises.

# How to use it
  - Online Version [here](https://eliapirrello.github.io/zenyth/)
  - Locallly: Clone git repo and run the following command in the project terminal:
  1. `npm install`
  2. `npm update`
  3. `npm run serve` to run development build
  OR
  3. `npm run build`, `npm install -g serve`, `serve -s dist` to run release build

<br>

Play the synth with your computer keyboard: `[a,w,s,e,d,f,t,g,y,h,u,j,k,o,l,p,ò,à]` 

Or connect a MIDI keyboard and reload the page!

(Connecting more than one MIDI/audio device could interfere with MIDI)

### FILTERS
Three parallel Filter Chains (Horizontal)

|   |   |                                     |  |
|---|---|-------------------------------------|---|
| <img src='res/Filters.png'  padding='5%' >|  Low Pass, Band and High Pass filters in serie | <img src='res/FilterCutoff.png'  >  | Drag Horizonatally to change frequency, vertically to change amount and resonance |

<br>

### EFFECTS
Three parallel Fx Chains (Vertical)

## How we built it

  
<br>

### Main framework and visuals:

- To achieve a simpler architecture and facilitate team cooperation, we used *Vue.js* as our main framework. The resulting graphical interface is a composition of custom Vue components, nested one into each other.
- All visual effects are realized in plain CSS, without any other library.
- The whole application is completely resizable, with a fixed aspect ratio and dimensions relative to the window's width.

  
<br>

### Audio Core:

- Tone.js was our initial choice to write the audio logic. As the code kept growing, the complexity increased too and the stock Tone objects weren't sufficient. We decided to wrap our main audio engines in more sophisticated and modular custom objects:
    - **MyPolySynth** - A polyphonic, multi-engine synthesizer with 6 modulator signals and a noise generator included in each voice. Each MyPolySynth can be initialized with a custom number of voices and a defined destination.
    - **MyFilter** - A multi-type filter (HP, BAND, LP), based on Tone.Filter, with the addition of 1 envelope and 1 LFO to modulate the cutoff frequency.
    - **MyFx** - A multi-Fx object, unifying 6 Tone effects in a single component.
    
    <br>
- Thanks to these wrappers, it's now possible to modulate synth pitch, synth volume, noise volume, and filter cutoff using both LFOs and envelopes. Simply set the modulation parameters and amount.
- Further updates aim to substitute Tone with the plain WebAudioAPI to improve latency and optimize the code further.
